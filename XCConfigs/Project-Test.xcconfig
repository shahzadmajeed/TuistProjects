// Debug Information Format
//
// The type of debug information to produce.
//
// * DWARF: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug information
// format. [dwarf]
// * DWARF with dSYM File: Object files and linked products will use DWARF as the debug
// information format, and Xcode will also produce a dSYM file containing the debug
// information from the individual object files (except that a dSYM file is not needed
// and will not be created for static library or object file products). [dwarf-with-dsym]

// need to be position-independent.

// Enable Testability
//
// When this setting is activated, the product will be built with options appropriate for
// running automated tests, such as making private interfaces accessible to the tests.
// This may result in tests running slower than they would without testability enabled.


ENABLE_TESTABILITY = YES

// Optimization Level
//
// Specifies the degree to which the generated code is optimized for speed and binary
// size.
//
// * None: Do not optimize. [-O0]
// With this setting, the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of compilation and to
// make debugging produce the expected results. Statements are independent—if you stop
// the program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to
// any variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the function and
// get exactly the results you would expect from the source code.
// * Fast: Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot more memory for a
// large function. [-O1]
// With this setting, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time,
// without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time. In
// Apple's compiler, strict aliasing, block reordering, and inter-block scheduling are
// disabled by default when optimizing.
// * Faster: The compiler performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not
// involve a space-speed tradeoff. [-O2]
// With this setting, the compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function
// inlining, or register renaming. As compared to the `Fast` setting, this setting
// increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
// * Fastest: Turns on all optimizations specified by the `Faster` setting and also
// turns on function inlining and register renaming options. This setting may result in a
// larger binary. [-O3]
// * Fastest, Smallest: Optimize for size. This setting enables all `Faster`
// optimizations that do not typically increase code size. It also performs further
// optimizations designed to reduce code size. [-Os]
// * Fastest, Aggressive Optimizations: This setting enables `Fastest` but also enables
// aggressive optimizations that may break strict standards compliance but should work
// well on well-behaved code. [-Ofast]
// * Smallest, Aggressive Size Optimizations: This setting enables additional size
// savings by isolating repetitive code patterns into a compiler generated function.
// [-Oz]

// of the built bundle.
